## Motivation

**lecturenotes** is a personalised .Rmd template that I use 
for writing my lecture notes and academic papers. It is intended for documents
that are going to be exported (i.e.  "knitted") to both HTML and PDF formats. In 
so doing, it tries to take care of various annoyances and inconsistencies that 
arise between these two formats. For example:

- Recognizing the author "affiliation" field in PDF documents.
- Support for consistent multi-column environments in both HTML and PDF.
- Support for non-standard fonts when knitting to PDF.
- Sensible handling of interactive content depending on the output format.
- Etc.

To get a sense of the resulting output, here are some screen grabs of the knitted template:

1. PDF ([live](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/lecturenotes/blob/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/template-name/skeleton/skeleton.pdf))
  ![](man/figures/knitted-pdf.png)

2. HTML ([live](http://raw.githack.com/grantmcdermott/lecturenotes/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/template-name/skeleton/skeleton.html))
  ![](man/figures/knitted-html.png) 

## Installation

I don't foresee submitting this bespoke package to CRAN. However, you can easily
install it from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("grantmcdermott/lecturenotes")
```

Once the package is installed, open up the **lecturenotes** template in RStudio 
by navigating to: 

```
File > New File > R Markdown > From Template > Lecture Notes (lecturenotes)
```

Clicking on the "Knit" button thereafter will automatically produce both output 
formats.


## Limitations

This R Markdown template was mostly designed for my own use. As such, it comes
with no guarantees; although, please do let me know if you run into problems. 
Some potential limitations and requirements perhaps worth highlighting:

- The PDF output has only been tested on a TexLive distribution using XeLaTeX. 
I cannot guarantee that other LaTeX distributions or engines will work without 
some tinkering. 
- Similarly, I have adopted some opinionated takes on optimal LaTeX fonts. I use
[Cochineal](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/cochineal) as the main font 
and [Fira](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/fira) for the sans and mono 
fonts. You may need to change or comment out [these lines](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/lecturenotes/blob/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/template-name/skeleton/skeleton.Rmd#L31-L33) 
of the template, depending on your own system and/or preferences.
- The template generally does a good job of automatically handling interactive 
content depending on the output format. For example, it tries to ignore 
interactive content when exporting to PDF. One notable exception is rendering of 
GIFs. I provide an example of how to handle this manually in the template itself.

## Acknowledgements

This template essentially pulls together a bunch of tips, tricks, and ideas that 
I've accumulated over time to fit my own idiosyncratic writing and formatting
needs. Some of these I stumbled upon on myself, most of them I found the
old-fashioned way (i.e. searching on the Internet). Here is a non-exhaustive 
list of helpful sources that I've drawn upon.
